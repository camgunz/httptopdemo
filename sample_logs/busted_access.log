## Implementation Improvements

  - Design an interface and avoid globals.
  - Don't presume a single log file; Go would make it easy to multiplex
    multiple logs
  - Use fsnotify and avoid the syscall package
  - Use a bona-fide console library instead of just dumping to console

## Design Improvements

  - I know httptop is a little contrived because it's just an assignment, but
    I tried to implement the spec so that it could be extended beyond just
    printing out events to the console.  Sending SMS alerts, pushing events to
    a database, updating graph
